|[class diagram](https://github.com/nxmyxxn/CS151-GroupUp/blob/main/diagrams/ClassDiagram.pdf)|The class diagram is used to visualize and describe the structure of a system in terms of classes, attributes, operations, and relationships. This is the class diagram of "GroupUp". It includes four classes and one enumeration. The User class can have multiple Schedules and a Schedule has multiple Days. In addition, the Day class makes use of an Availability enumeration to narrow a user's availability description, and the Creator is a subclass of the User that grants bonus functionalities. |
|[use case diagram](https://github.com/nxmyxxn/CS151-GroupUp/blob/main/diagrams/UseCaseDiagram.pdf)|The use case diagram shows the interaction between the system and the actors who use it. This diagram shows the interaction between certain actions and a user, the user's friend, another friend of the user who is also part of a group the user is a part of, and the administrator. Some actors may be able to participate in all or most of the actions, while some actors' actions may be limited.|
